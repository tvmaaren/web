		<h2 style="border-top-style: solid; border-width: 2px"> Setting up font</h2>
		<p>You will probably need to change the location of the font, before you can run the game. This you do by changing line 1 of `config.cfg`. By default this is the location of the font.</p>
		<i>/usr/share/fonts/TTF/DejaVuSansCondensed-Bold.ttf</i>
		<p>This is where this font is stored on Arch Linux. It is probably in a different location on your OS. For Debian this same font is stored here.</p>
		<i>/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSansCondensed-Bold.ttf</i>
		<p>If the font is not present on your system you might have to download it yourselve.</p>
		<h2 style="border-top-style: solid; border-width: 2px">Compilation</h2>
