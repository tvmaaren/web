	<p>I am an mathematics student at <a
		href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a>. This is my personal website where I publish
	everything I have made that I find interesting enough to share with the
	entire world.  This includes programs that I have written, but also
	things that are more creative like stories and plays.

		<h3>Zobrollo</h3>
		<p>Zobrollo is a 2d minimalistic top-view racing game programmed
		in C using the <a href=https://liballeg.org/>Allegro</a>
		library for Windows 10 and GNU/Linux. At this point of
		development you can only play in Time Trial. The game also keeps of
		track of records you have made and you are able to rewatch
		previous races and play against them.</p>

		<h3>AsciiMind</h3>
		This is a command-line game based on the classic board game "Mastermind". It differs in that instead of colours it uses ASCII characters. This is nice, because there are more ASCII characters than distinguishable colours. What is also neat is that after every guess you make you see how many possible answers there are left.<br>
